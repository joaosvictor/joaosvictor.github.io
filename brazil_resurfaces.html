            <p class="fontBox">Almost passed 1 month since the elections, I can say that democracy has breathing in Brazil, the far-right is down, Bolsonaro is down, Lula is the new president of Brazil, this is some happiness for those who support the democracy and believe, that love is stronger than the hate.</p>
            <br class="bra">
    
            <p class="fontBox">After 4 difficult years, we can have the hope of a country that offers democracy on his own, offers health, education, take care of the  environment and see the workers with another sight.</p>
            <br class="bra">
    
            <p class="fontBox">Even winning the elections, we can say that we loose it some how, 58 millions of people gave their vote to a fascist candidate, it's true that more than the half of this number don't even know what a fascist is and his ideas, but they voted by the fake promises and the ignorant talk he say. the defeat in this elections is to know that half of Brazil is conservative and put the religion and their habits over everything.</p>
            <br class="bra">

            <p class="fontBox">Bolsonaro is not even close to a polite person, with his ignorant way, he killed 700,000 of people in the covid-19 pandemic just by the fact he was denialist, he doesn’t believe in vaccines, zero trust in their efficiency, shutting down more people, he also delayed the purchase of oxygen tubes for hospitals, this is how the far-right acts with their thoughts, denying science and prioritizing their conservative ideas, often following a religious principle to mask their intolerances and prejudices.</p>
            <br class="bra">

            <p class="fontBox">During his mandate he speared many attacks on the brazillian democracy, we passed 4 years with the fear of a military coup. This year a letter in defense of democracy was read at the university of usp, in São Paulo. The letter defends the democratic rule of law. I even participated in the act on August 11.</p>
            <br class="bra">

            <p class="fontBox">We can say that Bolsonaro ruined all areas during his government, one that suffered more together with health and education is the environment, Amazon was dying on his hands, his minister, Ricardo Salles is responsible for much of the deforestation that has occurred in the Amazon region. Bolsonaro also never looked with care to the CO2 problem that we face now a days.</p>
            <br class="bra">

            <p class="fontBox">Lula is already showing how different his government is going to be, and he hasn't even assumed the post of president yet. In the COP27 conference, Lula showed passion on the cause of facing the climate change and taking care of the environment, placing Brazil back in the global debate.</p>
            <br class="bra">
    
            <p class="fontBox">That said, the year that comes, we will be able to see how Lula gonna drive Brazil, one thing is certain, Brazil can breath again, with no air of facists ideas and supporters. I hope Bolsonaro can be excluded from the main stage of politics.</p>
            <br class="bra">
    
            <p class="fontBox">My opinion is that, it’s gonna be difficult years ahead, we must work hard to eliminate the thoughts that Bolsonaro have left on the brazilian people. With much love and education, I think we can have better and more prosperous years for those who need it most, who knows Brazil in the Future can have some communist leader to lead us to the glory, that’s what I think is essential, a society that thinks and lives in favor of workers and the poorest. </p>
