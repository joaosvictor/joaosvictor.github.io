            <p class="fontBox">Structural unemployment has been one of the last discussions about the evolution of the technology. With the new “professions” going up, the old ones maybe is going to disappear by the fact that them don’t fill the new roles that the capitalist market show up.</p>
            <br class="bra">
    
            <p class="fontBox">A huge example of that happening is the factory’s industry that changed last few years from human work by the machines and robotics methods that costs cheaper and is way more fast value compared to the human one.</p>
            <br class="bra">
    
            <p class="fontBox">While in the past, we also had the difference by the humans, in the run of pursuit a better education for a topper job role at the top enterprises at the market. That's the why people from farm and the factory suffered more than the people that has a title of a job with the arrival of the the machines to replace the first "kind”. That said, I’m not even entering the fact that a bunch of people had their jobs taken over by online stores.</p>
            <br class="bra">

            <p class="fontBox">But now a days, we have a new problem to deal with - It's called "artificial intelligence". I don't like this name because AI is nothing more than algorithms, and algorithms is built in math, and math was discovered from the nature. That's another good discussion, is math discovered or invented by the man?</p>
            <br class="bra">

            <p class="fontBox">With the growth of AI, prestigious professions such as a lawyer, doctor or teacher have increasingly been taken over by computers. even programmers who are considered the "profession" of the future are at risk. Soon programmers and others software developers(fired by expressive numbers today) will start to have fewer and fewer jobs as we will have much more done by GPT-3 evolutions and others AI models</p>
            <br class="bra">

            <p class="fontBox">Our discussion now is that: How we can merge the news technologies that emerge with the existence professions and create new ones that across with the AI? One solution I come with up is that we should slow down the process of replace the human work with AI and study/understand how to put together the human relationship with the computers. In this way, I think we can build a place where we can have the help of the AI and still have the people with value on the track.</p>
