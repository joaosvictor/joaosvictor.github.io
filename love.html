        <p class="fontBox">Why love can be considered a disease? I think love can be considered a disease by the simple reason that love cause you fear. A love that doesn't make you afraid, doesn’t take off the meaning of life, doesn’t kill you, it isn’t true love. Love is disease. “A disease of the soul”, as Pondé once said. Hope nobody doubt it.  But at the same time, i think love is salvation, a strong feeling that lands you to a state never seen before, a state that can change you drastically, for better or for worse. Love is intense as fuck.</p>
        <br class="bra">

        <p class="fontBox">For this intensity, people in our contemporary world have moved away from love, looking less and less for a passion. In this mediocre world that people are ruled by the search for a longer life, they believe that move away from love - that kills, as known -  is the best option for their “health” life. But, a short life with love can worth a thousand years without it. However there is no doubt that a person who loves feel way more stronger to risk getting out of the everyday cliche.</p>
        <br class="bra">

        <p class="fontBox">Since love is a disease, does it have a cure? That's a good question, perhaps, for me, the cure for love is letting it come true. Love just has no cure when it dies.</p>
