        <p class="fontBox">Structurally, social media cause anxiety for the simple fact that they saturate everyday life, with the most diverse narratives, many of them simply content spread by weird individuals and previously silenced by their own irrelevance, or by groups and companies that live off the most irresponsible shots.</p>
        <br class="bra">

        <p class="fontBox">Even the responsible use of social media implies increased anxiety because the human species evolved in an environment of silence and few words. Always remember that we have existed as sapiens for at least 250,000 years, and therefore the last 30 years has been an unusual experience with all this technology.</p>
        <br class="bra">

        <p class="fontBox">We talk too much, we inform ourselves too much, we come into contact with too much content and people, creating a general saturation of distant relationships, creating a noisy environment that we have never known in our years of history. Our species is lost in a panorama that is not ours, this saturation of noise and content in real time puts us at the center of an increase in anxiety that we have never experienced before.</p>
        
        
        <p class="fontBox">Anxiety related to this process appears, for example, in the increase of ostentation, envy, hatred and searches for medical information (since our current world is obsessed with health). Technologies are evolving very fast, so phones and apps grow along with all of this technology. Consumption and anxiety go hand in hand. More options, more anxiety for the customer choose</p>
         

        <p class="fontBox">In the end, we all lose it, but one way to try to overcome anxiety is not to want too much. Whoever wants a lot ends up drowning in a sea of illusion and confrontation.</p>
