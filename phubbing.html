            <p class="fontBox">Have you ever caught yourself on cellphone during a conversation with someone? or did this ever happen to you? of course this is something nobody want to pass, there is no way this is comfortable. The name of this action is phubbing - the act of ignore the people around us in favor of the cellphone. In our new way to live is this world(a capitalized world), this action became normal and more often to see.</p>
            <br class="bra">

            <p class="fontBox">Phubbing can fish us to a net in many ways, just to realize that your friendship isn’t the same or even more the relationship with your partner has being cracked because of it,people in the real world feel like they have no value anymore or it hurts directly with the ego of them, since they are second option, losing attention to a brightness screen. Furthermore, phubbing can impair our communication and ability to interact with other people, as we are focusing on our cell phones instead of paying attention to what people are saying.</p>
            <br class="bra">

            <p class="fontBox">Excessive use of the cell phone can also negatively affect our mental and physical health, as it can lead to anxiety, depression, lack of sleep, and sedentary lifestyle. Phubbing has negative consequences on our social, emotional, and physical life. When people are ignored in favor of the cell phone, they may feel less valued, and this can harm relationships. In addition, focusing on the cell phone instead of paying attention to what people are saying can harm our ability to communicate and social interaction. Excessive use of the cell phone can also negatively affect our mental health, leading to problems such as anxiety and depression, as well as affecting sleep quality and leading to sedentary lifestyle. It is important to make people aware of the negative effects of phubbing and balance cell phone use with social interaction and healthy behaviors.</p>
            <br class="bra">

            <p class="fontBox">Moreover, phubbing can also lead to reduced productivity and efficiency. Whether at work or in school, constantly checking our phones can distract us from our tasks and hamper our performance. Research has indicated that even the mere presence of a cell phone can reduce cognitive capacity, even when it's not in use.</p>
            <br class="bra">

            <p class="fontBox">The impact of phubbing on children and adolescents is another area of concern. By witnessing adults in their lives constantly on their phones, children may learn to imitate this behaviour. This can potentially lead to early onset of unhealthy digital habits, impacting their social skills and emotional development.</p>
            <br class="bra">

            <p class="fontBox">However, acknowledging the problem is the first step towards finding a solution. By becoming aware of our phone habits and consciously limiting our screen time, we can strive to reduce phubbing. It can be beneficial to set aside specific times in the day for phone use, and strictly adhere to these schedules. During social interactions, we can make it a point to keep our phones out of sight, thereby reducing the temptation to check it.</p>
            <br class="bra">

            <p class="fontBox">Phubbing is a phenomenon that is still not widely known, despite its prevalence in our everyday lives. Therefore, it is essential to raise awareness about phubbing and its potential consequences. Schools, workplaces, and community centers can play a crucial role in this process by organizing workshops and seminars on the topic. In addition, mental health professionals and counsellors can also provide guidance on how to cope with the psychological impact of phubbing.</p>
            <br class="bra">

            <p class="fontBox">In conclusion, while we cannot completely eliminate the use of cellphones from our lives, we can certainly make a conscious effort to use them responsibly. By finding a balance between our digital and real-world interactions, we can combat the negative effects of phubbing and foster healthier, more meaningful relationships.</p>
